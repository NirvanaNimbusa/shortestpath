##Intro
The shortestpath package provides functions to solve the shortest path problem by using the Dijkstra-, Floyd-Warshall, A*Search and Bellman-Ford algorithm. Additionally, the package offers 
the tabular and graphical visualization of the shortest path optimization steps. 

## Create a Graph
As a first step the function randomGraph() can be used in order to create a undirected graph "g" with positive edge weights. 
```{r}
g <- randomGraph(5, euclidean=FALSE)
```
The parameter "5" indicates the number of vertices of the randomly generated graph. In addition, a boolean paramter "euclidean" (default = FALSE) can be set in order to signify if the graph should include euclidean distances (This is only needed for the A*Search algorithm). 

## Dijkstra algorithm 
Use the Dijkstra algrithm to find the shortest path between the two vertices "A" and "E" in the graph "g".
```{r}
d <- dijkstra(g, "A", "E")
```
The variable "d" contains a list of igraphs. These igraphs have additional attributes and are therefore called shortest path graphs (spgraphs). Each spgraph represents one optimization step of the Dijkstra algorithm.

## Plot 
Use the normal plot function to print all the steps of the Dijkstra algorithm. 
```{r,fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0),mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(d)
```
A detailed explanation of the single optimization steps can be read in the processing vignette.

Additionally, the minimum distance table can be printed by calling the attribute "min_dists" of each spgraph.
```{r}
 for(step in d){ 
   print(step$min_dists)
   cat("\n")
   }
```
