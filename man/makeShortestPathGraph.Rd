\title{Convert an igraph into a shortest path graph}
\usage{
makeShortestPathGraph(graph, from, to)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The \code{igraph} object.}

\item{from}{The graph's source vertex for single-source algorithms.
For all-shortest-paths algorithms, \code{FALSE} should be passed.}
}
\value{
The \code{spgraph} object.
}
\description{
You usually do not need to call this function directly.
Instead, supply an igraph to one of the algorithms, which then outputs suitable spgraph objects.
